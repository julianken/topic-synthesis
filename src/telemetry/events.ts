 * fans `WorkflowEvent`s to N adapters (stdout → Cloud Logging, the `step_event` projection for the
 * live generating UI, a no-op for tests). Adding a future per-step event type is a one-line change:
 * add a union variant + emit it; each sink decides whether to project it.
 *
 * Fence-clean by construction (imports only a type) so it rides into the compiled Job bundle.
